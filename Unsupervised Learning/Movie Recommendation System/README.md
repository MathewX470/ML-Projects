# Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning project that builds a movie recommendation system using unsupervised learning techniques.

## Dataset

- **Source**: IMDB Top 1000 Movies
- **File**: `imdb_top_1000.csv`

## Features

- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Content-based filtering
- Similarity analysis
- Movie recommendations based on user preferences

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Structure

```
Movie Recommendation System/
├── imdb_top_1000.csv           # Dataset
├── movie_recommendation.ipynb  # Main notebook
└── README.md                   # Project documentation
```

## Usage

1. Open `movie_recommendation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and explore the dataset
   - Preprocess the data
   - Build the recommendation model
   - Get movie recommendations

## Future Enhancements
